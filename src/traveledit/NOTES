maybe the bottom middle button can be paste
(instead of insert if the last thing you did was copy!)

the new paste doesn't work with reordering files

invisible buttons are good if you mind is changing context anyway?
like searching, or alt tab. Bad if your mind isn't changing context.
the bottom area should be able to dup/cut/copy/paste/comment (select might be ok top right because of the flow)
maybe you can incorporate double taps?
or maybe the next most action after you copy is paste now?
or maybe get used to invisible buttons more
or maybe you have middle, then up down left right?


bug, we dont't autocomplete string methods
remember in your new paste mode, if the next action is left and right cursor then you move left and right what was just pasted
I kind of like that next action stuff.
very contexty

better handle undo on auto complete line. I think you just need to call docChanged

fix it so when you are in  search mode, you can still go to edit mode by tapping on the bottom  
make the  save button be handled on touch start. so  input doesn't lose Focus


maybe only do autoCompleteLine if last action is Type


wrangle bottom two middleButtons
pasting slash commenting.
insertMode vsNot insert mode
maybe bottom 2 buttons shouldAlways bePaste
because we alreadyHave content above?
nah, butYou don't always want to go high to comment


Consider not selecting at all when doing traditional inline paste!
this thing is traditional inline 
swipe typing and entering parens.
wrangle the verticalTouchSize not being right in debug mode.
wrangle the  parentheses after swipe typing
don't allow 0 length selection

* Re- reconcile the differences between
  invisible buttons when selected and when not selected

* Adjust the verticalTouchSize when the keyboard is open
* initial load don't select the right file
* on screen share when you go to a file for the first time
  it didn't  display any text until sharer moves cursor

*  Prevent a 0-width selection
      
* Audit the feature where you delete a word and then
it automatically copies the new word you typed
and searches for the word you deleted
that feature also spent sen to work well with
swipe type?

* select in quote

clear after? hold down from right side?
autocomplete line
audit when you paste inline and it's still selected
select in quotes
the move by word should work for selection too
